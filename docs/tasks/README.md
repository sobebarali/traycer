## Development Principles

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Always** write tests before implementation
- Tests define expected behavior
- Implement to make tests pass
- Refactor with confidence

### 2. Quality First
- Run `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run format` after every change
- Maintain ‚â•80% test coverage
- Fix warnings immediately
- No shortcuts on quality

### 3. Incremental Progress
- Complete phases in order
- Don't skip ahead without completing dependencies
- Validate each phase before moving on
- Document as you go

### 4. User-Centric
- Think from user perspective
- Provide helpful error messages
- Optimize for developer experience
- Make it easy to use

## Next Immediate Tasks

**Current Phase**: Phase 2 - Type System & Data Models

To continue development, start with:

1. [Phase 2.1](./phase-02-types.md#21-create-core-types): Create core types in `src/types/index.ts`
2. [Phase 2.2](./phase-02-types.md#22-create-analysis-types): Add analysis types
3. [Phase 2.3](./phase-02-types.md#23-create-verification-types): Add verification types
4. [Phase 2.4](./phase-02-types.md#24-create-utility-types): Add utility types and type guards

Then proceed to Phase 3 (Utility Layer).
