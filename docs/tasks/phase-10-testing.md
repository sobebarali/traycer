**Status**: ⏳ NOT STARTED
**Priority**: HIGH
**Dependencies**: All previous phases
**Progress**: 0%

---

## Overview

Comprehensive testing and quality assurance before release.

---

## Goals

- [ ] Achieve target test coverage (≥80%)
- [ ] Comprehensive integration testing
- [ ] Manual testing in real projects
- [ ] Code quality validation

---

## Tasks

### 10.1 Unit Test Coverage
**Targets**:
- [ ] Core modules: ≥85% coverage
- [ ] Utilities: ≥80% coverage
- [ ] UI logic: ≥75% coverage
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Test error scenarios

### 10.2 Integration Testing
**Files to Create**: `test/integration/e2e.test.ts`

**Scenarios**:
- [ ] Complete plan generation flow
- [ ] Plan display and interaction
- [ ] Plan verification flow
- [ ] Error scenarios
- [ ] End-to-end workflows

### 10.3 Manual Testing
**Test In**:
- [ ] Small TypeScript project
- [ ] Medium-sized project
- [ ] Large codebase
- [ ] React project
- [ ] Node.js project
- [ ] Different VS Code themes
- [ ] Different OS (macOS, Windows, Linux)

**Edge Cases**:
- [ ] No workspace open
- [ ] Empty workspace
- [ ] Project with errors
- [ ] Cancellation scenarios

### 10.4 Code Quality
**Checks**:
- [ ] Run `npm run typecheck` (passes)
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` (no warnings)
- [ ] Run `npm run format` (formatted)
- [ ] Run `npm test` (all pass)
- [ ] Code review checklist
- [ ] Security audit

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Test coverage meets targets
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Quality checks pass
- [ ] Performance acceptable
