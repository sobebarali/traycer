# Traycer Documentation

Welcome to the Traycer documentation! This guide will help you understand, use, and contribute to the Traycer VS Code extension.

## What is Traycer?

Traycer is a VS Code extension that acts as an intelligent planning layer for development tasks. It helps developers transform vague ideas into structured, actionable development plans, reducing "AI drift" and maintaining focus throughout implementation.

## Project Philosophy

Traycer is built on the principle that **structured planning prevents implementation drift**. By creating clear, actionable plans before writing code, developers can:

- Stay focused on the original goal
- Avoid scope creep
- Make better architectural decisions
- Reduce bugs and technical debt
- Improve code quality
